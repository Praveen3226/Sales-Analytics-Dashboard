Problem Statement
The company faces challenges in effectively analyzing and interpreting its sales data, resulting
in potential inefficiencies in decision-making and sales strategies. There is a need to consolidate
and visualize critical information related to orders, shipping, customers, and product details to
identify patterns, optimize processes, and ultimately improve sales performance. The goal is to
address these challenges through the development of an insightful Power BI dashboard.

The primary objective of this project is to create a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard
that enables stakeholders to:
1. Gain Overview: Obtain a quick overview of key sales metrics, such as total sales, average
unit price, and total unit cost.
2. Analyze Sales Trends: Visualize sales trends over time using line charts or time series
visuals to identify peak sales periods and potential seasonality.
3. Customer Insights: Explore customer-related metrics, such as the number of orders per
customer and total sales per customer, to identify high-value customers.
4. Channel Analysis: Analyze sales performance across different channels (e.g., online, offline)
to identify the most effective sales channels.
5. Currency Impact: Understand the impact of currency fluctuations on sales by visualizing
sales data in different currencies.
6. Warehouse Efficiency: Evaluate warehouse performance by analyzing order fulfillment
times, shipping delays, and overall order processing efficiency.

7. Product Performance: Assess the performance of individual products through visuals such
as bar charts or heatmaps, identifying top-selling products and potential inventory management
opportunities.
8. Cost and Profitability: Visualize the relationship between unit price, total unit cost, and profit
margins to optimize pricing strategies.
9. Regional Analysis: Explore sales patterns across different delivery regions to tailor
marketing and sales efforts based on regional demand.
